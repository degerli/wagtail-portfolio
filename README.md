Wagtail Onepage Portfolio Starter

A simple portfolio page made with Wagtail and Bootstrap. Everything is configurable inside Wagtail admin. Nothing hardcoded.

To install:

1. Create a virtual env 
2. Git clone https://github.com/webconexus/wagtail-portfolio.git
3. cd into the directory and use pip install -r requirements.txt

I used PostgreSQL instead of SQLite so you should change the base.py located in portfolio/settings before running migrations.
